TripPlanner is an application designed to help users plan trips more efficiently by easily comparing important factors of two different trips side by side. The goal is for users to be able to compare factors like hotel and travel prices while adjusting certain characteristics such as trip dates and hotel or travel method of choice to assist in optimizing planning the best trip possible while aiming for a certain budget. 

Users can create individual trips that can later be use to generate the comparisons.
